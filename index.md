## Projects

__Flexible LoRaWAN Sensor Board__

For an <a href="https://ap-it-gh.github.io/iot-at-kist/#/">international project</a> in Zanzibar I developed an air quality sensor together with 5 other students from AP university of Applied Sciences. The PCB's were designed and produced in Belgium. In Zanzibar we set up a LoRaWAN infrastructure, assembled the PCB's, programmed the microcontrollers on the PCB's and set up a NodeRED backend. I was personally responsible for the programming of the <a href="https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/aemDocuments/documents/MCU32/ProductDocuments/DataSheets/SAM-D21-DA1-Family-Data-Sheet-DS40001882H.pdf">microcontroller</a>.

__Digitization of an ice cream truck melody__

The first project I worked on at Tamm Industries was the digitization of a melody from a "music box" of my local ice cream truck. Digitizing technology from the 70's allowed him to expand his bussiness to more ice cream trucks without relying on old technology.

__Weather station hacking__

Students from the AI division needed weather data from a weather station. Using a HackRF One I was able to intercept and decode the data from a weather station so that the students would be able to use that data to make predictions.

## Other Interests
__Climbing__

Indoor/Outdoor

__Void Warranties__

Void Warranties is a hackerspace situated in Deurne, Antwerp. I like going there to discuss technology with other like minded people.

__Film__

I'm quite interested in filmmaking. I have done some work as an extra in a TV show and I have helped on set of two short movies as a production assistant.
